  <p>update1: I GOT SO MUCH DONE TODAY!!!!! Expect a map online tomorrow, or check out my <a href="https://github.com/SeaWolfos/Stake-Pool-Map">github</a> over here. I'm going at a snail's pace because I'm learning a ton but hey, we're getting it done. Feel free to contribute!
  <p>[Insert Map Here]</p>
  <p>Calico Mining Company (#CALI pool) just bought this domain on Friday 13 March, 2020! We're going to put in a map of all the Cardano Staking Pools this weekend.</p>
  <p>Coming soon, we will have a way for you to make an account and specify where your pool is! We'll pull the data from IP Address location, which isn't always 100% accurate.</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by! I'll love you forever if you send me a tip Ae2tdPwUPEZKGSKEvmwhoVVjjLmNiAKAacoJQRo8bLHTztvRohYJEu8Sriw or delegate to my pool #CALI 1933716364a62905b0fb5fade6e45c4f6f72d65e5240ef0ae5d8ddd08dfd9471</p>
