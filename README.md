##### Cardano Stake Pool Map

So first, let me say that I have NO IDEA what I'm doing. Okay, maybe half of an idea. The end goal of this project will be a website that displays a map of Cardano Stake Pools. Listings will be based on geolocation. Eventually, I would like to add support for stake pool operators to create an account and modify locations, clarifying not-quite-accurate ip geo information. 

The app will pull IP address geolocations on a reasonable basis and update them in a PostgreSQL database from which the website will get its listings. In the spirit of open source, maps will come from Open Street Maps.

## Delegate to my pool!

Like what I've made? Please delegate to my pool! It's the #CALI pool. I don't have much of anything delegated there and, as of writing this, haven't made any blocks yet.

## Leave a tip

Really like what I've made? I drank a lot of coffee to make this. Buy me a coffee! Ae2tdPwUPEZKGSKEvmwhoVVjjLmNiAKAacoJQRo8bLHTztvRohYJEu8Sriw
